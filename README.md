# The Fate of the United States - Can We Predict the 2020 Election?  
Drawing inspiration from Nate Silverâ€™s FiveThirtyEight election predictions, we want to investigate how data science can give us insights on the outcome of one of the most watched and polarizing presidential elections in the world. By performing exploratory data analysis and building various machine learning models and a multiple linear regression model to predict the outcome of the election, we hope to identify what factors drive the current American political climate.

## Analyses: <a name = "analyses">    
We created predictions of the 2020 election outcome by predicting the ratio of percent democrat votes to percent republican votes for each county and using these to calculated the electoral college returns.  
  * [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/mukundpoddar1/2020-election-predictions/tree/main/EDA): We created a Shiny app to create exploratory vizualizations of our data.  
  * [Map our Results](https://github.com/mukundpoddar1/2020-election-predictions/tree/main/results): We created a Shiny app to map the results of our four prediction models and compare them against the actual outcome of the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
  * [Modeling Analysis](https://github.com/mukundpoddar1/2020-election-predictions/blob/main/scripts/ml_models.Rmd): Here we perform all of our modeling analysis and detail how each of our models performed. We detail our data standardization procedures for modeling procedures [here](https://github.com/mukundpoddar1/2020-election-predictions/blob/main/test_set_scale.md).
